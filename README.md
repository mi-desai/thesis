### Abstract

This project was created to transform accounting statements away from their principally tabular form to a visual interface designed in accordance with the principles of information design. Income statements were chosen because of their relatively straightforward, but highly variable accounting structure. 

The tool allows users to explore five years of four companies' data:

<ul>
    <li>Cheniere Energy Inc</li>
    <li>Tesla Inc</li>
    <li>Facebook</li>
    <li>Alphabet Inc (the parent company of Google)</li>
</ul>

Data on these companies was obtained from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, where all publicly traded entities on US exchanges file financial performance data. Using the work of Rolf Hichert as a starting point, the project applies Hichert's work on International Business Communication Standards to company financial statements, which are the primary source of most corporate financial data.

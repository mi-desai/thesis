Thesis Topics Outline
Finance
Financial Education and Resources
Financial Education is oriented towards modeling using accounting data.
Corporate Governance
Are Strategic Decisions about Corporations that affect a great number of people made using Data Visualizations?
Research Question: Does visual notation aid in the understanding of corporate financial performance and provide a method for understanding corporate performance that doesn't require many months of study to understand, like traditional table-based accounting?
Corporations are often accused of manipulation of their financial statements and regulatory disclosures for the benefit of their own aims and to the detriment of the general public and shareholders. There have been multiple instances of this (see: Enron, Worldcom, Sinoforest, etc.
What can be done to detect misrepresented company financial data?
Create a visual format or notation that shows or points out all of these (possible) misrepresentations when they occur.
Hiding Liabilities
Mergers and Acquisitions
Revenue and Expense Matching
Use of accrual versus cash accounting.
Accounting
Financial Statements for US Publicly Traded Companies
Use XBRL Markup to make data easy to scrape from SEC Website.
Common source of information on performance of industries and trends, competitive intelligence, and commentary.
Most common encoding format is Excel or spreadsheet based technologies.
A new format from more structured XBRL documents might provide the basis of more visual method of corporate financial performance.
Notes to Financial Statements for US Publicly Traded Companies
Use XBRL Markup to make data easy to scrape from SEC website.
Most common format for reading and parsing is either in Excel or just reading the document for the Notes.
Because of the value of scraping and storing these data, which describes information in the statements, only companies have scraped the Notes, but nobody has done it for the general public, including students and journalists.
US GAAP Accounting Standards
USA: Adoption of XBRL XML markup on all financial statements in 2009
UK: Adoption of XBRL XML markup standard in 2015
Other countries and regulatory bodies around globe to follow suite, so XBRL structured data may be the source of a large amount of corporate financial data for visual analytics in the future.
Psychology of Attention
What causes the misinterpretation of company financial data (when it is true)?
Replication Crisis across academic research fields
Spreadsheet Error is a major culprit of lack of replication in a lot of financial research.
Professor Panko, Reinhartdt and Rogoff
Behavioral Economics - Heuristics
Is visual analytics the most efficient way to relay key financial information about performance? Does this represent an evolution from the table-based reading and interpretation of financial statements?
International Business Communication Standards (ICBS) - Rolf Hichert and Jurgen Faisst - developed a visual notation to convey the same amount of information as tabular format, in a visual format.
Cognitive Biases
Are there biases in the presentation of information that can affect how financial data is received or interpreted by decision makers or by the public?
Kanehman and Tversky: Thinking Fast and Slow - Differences between intuitive versus deliberative information processing.
Most financial tabular interpretations like those found in accounting statements or disclosures of corporate performance are heavy on using System 2 - deliberative. Can visual analytics and presentation format change the speed of interpretation and bypass jargon?
What can be done to detect misrepresented company financial data (i.e. when it is false?)
Open-Source Data and Software
What alternatives are there to Excel-based financial reports?
XML
The US SEC has created an In-line XML Schema for Web Documents for Publicly-Traded Companies called XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language), making it far easier to scrape these data.
US Securities and Exchange Commission Standards on US GAAP XBRL are implemented.
Can XBRL standards be used effectively to create structured data from financial statements and their notes, such that they can be used in a series of data visualizations?




Financial Statement Visualization. Can visual notation aid in the understanding of regulatory disclosures related to corporate financial performance and provide a method to avoid misinterpretation of financial data and point out misrepresentation?
Financial Statements require significant professional training to read and interpret correctly.
Most financial models that are built off of financial statements use Excel or spreadsheet-based technology.
Spreadsheet error is a rampant problem that causes misinterpretation of data.
Panko, Reinhardt, Rogoff Research demonstrate the scale of the problem.
Impact: Austerity measures were implemented in various Eurozone countries that were based on the incorrect entry of data into certain spreadsheet cells, impacting the livelihoods of millions.
There are now alternatives to just using spreadsheets thanks to regulatory bodies like the SEC enforcing new standardization.
The US SEC has created an In-line XML Schema for Web Documents for Publicly-Traded Companies called XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language), making it far easier to scrape these data.
Other countries are using their own XML Schema to mark-up their countries' financial regulatory filings, creating a new standard that can sidestep problems of spreadsheet error.
Impact: XML and XBRL may form the basis for more structured data that makes more data visualization possible.
Financial data visualization has barely evolved beyond the tabular format.
International Business Communication Standards (Hichert), which create a visual notation for the effective communication of business reporting and insights.
Financial Reports can be easy to misinterpret, which can be caused by:
Replication Crisis (which may be due to spreadsheet error and limitations of spreadsheets).
Structured markup language and technology make it more difficult to introduce cell error into reporting and visualization.
Heuristics (mental assumptions) about what data means, that are often incorrect.
Can visualizations and presentation format improve retention, accuracy, and correct interpretation? Yes.
Kanehman: System 1 Intuitive Thinking
Visual versions of the same financial disclosures can improve speed absorbing the disclosure information, while not sacrificing any accuracy.
International Business Communication Standards (Hichert), which create a visual notation for the effective communication of business reporting and insights.
Impact: Faster and more accurate interpretation of corporate financial data may lead to better decision making by corporate stake holders, and more input from the public on corporate governance and responsibility.
Kanehman: System 2 Deliberative Thinking
Current financial disclosures require heavy cognitive load via System 2 Deliberative Thinking.
Impact: Analysts, Students, Public with training have high cognitive load demands while reading company disclosures, limiting absorption of information.Those without training to interpret current formats are without recourse.
Incorporate Gestalt Principles: Common, often visual heuristics that aid understanding of a concept or dataset.
Figure-Ground (i.e. foreground or background?)
Similarity (e.g. similarities in symbology often are trying to communicate a similar function)
Proximity (things closer together are more related than things farther apart)
Common Region (if objects are grouped within a similar closed region, they are perceived as grouped together.)
Continuity (e.g. forming dots into a line)
Closure (complex visual arrangements tend to make people want to look for a single recognizable pattern)
Focal Point (whatever stands out visually will capture and hold the viewer's attention first).
Cognitive Biases
Biases can be established or removed via presentation format.
Impact: This drives away stakeholders who may be impacted by corporate financial performance because of the difficulties of current presentation format.
Impact: This can misinform stakeholders who do pay attention or can read financial regulatory disclosures.
Financial Reports may be misrepresented.
Incorporation of visual notation to point out common financial reporting misrepresentations or points of confusion.
Accrual Versus Cash Accounting.
Revenue and Expense Matching.
Off-Balance Sheet Liabilities.
Goodwill in Mergers and Acquisitions.

Outline: 

# Research Question: Financial Statement Visualization. Can visual notation aid in the understanding of regulatory disclosures related to corporate financial performance and provide a method to avoid misinterpretation of financial data and point out misrepresentation?

## Premise: Financial Statements require significant professional training to read and interpret correctly.

## Claims/Arguments 1: Most financial models that are built off of financial statements use Excel or spreadsheet-based technology.

### Spreadsheet error is a rampant problem that causes misinterpretation of data.
Panko, Reinhardt, Rogoff Research demonstrate the scale of the problem.
Impact: Austerity measures were implemented in various Eurozone countries that were based on the incorrect entry of data into certain spreadsheet cells, impacting the livelihoods of millions.


### There are now alternatives to just using spreadsheets thanks to regulatory bodies like the SEC enforcing new standardization.
The US SEC has created an In-line XML Schema for Web Documents for Publicly-Traded Companies called XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language), making it far easier to scrape these data.
Other countries are using their own XML Schema to mark-up their countries' financial regulatory filings, creating a new standard that can sidestep problems of spreadsheet error.
Impact: XML and XBRL may form the basis for more structured data that makes more data visualization possible.


### Financial data visualization has barely evolved beyond the tabular format.
International Business Communication Standards (Hichert), which create a visual notation for the effective communication of business reporting and insights.


## Claims/Arguments 2: Financial Reports can be easy to misinterpret, which can be caused by:

### Replication Crisis (which may be due to spreadsheet error and limitations of spreadsheets).
Structured markup language and technology make it more difficult to introduce cell error into reporting and visualization.

### Heuristics (mental assumptions) about what data means, that are often incorrect.
Can visualizations and presentation format improve retention, accuracy, and correct interpretation? Yes.
Kanehman: System 1 Intuitive Thinking
Visual versions of the same financial disclosures can improve speed absorbing the disclosure information, while not sacrificing any accuracy.
International Business Communication Standards (Hichert), which create a visual notation for the effective communication of business reporting and insights.
Impact: Faster and more accurate interpretation of corporate financial data may lead to better decision making by corporate stake holders, and more input from the public on corporate governance and responsibility.
Kanehman: System 2 Deliberative Thinking
Current financial disclosures require heavy cognitive load via System 2 Deliberative Thinking.
Impact: Analysts, Students, Public with training have high cognitive load demands while reading company disclosures, limiting absorption of information.Those without training to interpret current formats are without recourse.
Incorporate Gestalt Principles: Common, often visual heuristics that aid understanding of a concept or dataset.
Figure-Ground (i.e. foreground or background?)
Similarity (e.g. similarities in symbology often are trying to communicate a similar function)
Proximity (things closer together are more related than things farther apart)
Common Region (if objects are grouped within a similar closed region, they are perceived as grouped together.)
Continuity (e.g. forming dots into a line)
Closure (complex visual arrangements tend to make people want to look for a single recognizable pattern)
Focal Point (whatever stands out visually will capture and hold the viewer's attention first).

### Cognitive Biases
Biases can be established or removed via presentation format.
Impact: This drives away stakeholders who may be impacted by corporate financial performance because of the difficulties of current presentation format.
Impact: This can misinform stakeholders who do pay attention or can read financial regulatory disclosures.

## Claims/Arguments 3: Financial Reports may be misrepresented.

### Incorporation of visual notation to point out common financial reporting misrepresentations or points of confusion.
